# Tic-Tac-Toe with Python

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe project implemented in Python. In this game, two players take turns placing their "X" or "O" marks on a 3x3 board to achieve victory or a draw and end the game.

## How to Run

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Download or copy the code.
2. Install the termcolor2 library. You can use the following command:pip install termcolor2
3. Run the code:python tic_tac_toe.py

## How to Play

1. When the code is executed, Player 1 will be asked to choose their symbol, either "X" or "O" (uppercase or lowercase).
2. The game board will be displayed as follows:

   1   |   2   |   3   
-----------------------
   4   |   5   |   6   
-----------------------
   7   |   8   |   9   

3. Players take turns entering the number corresponding to the cell where they want to place their symbol. For example, if Player 1 is "X" and wants to place an "X" in cell 1, they will enter the number 1.
4. The game continues until one of the players wins or it ends in a draw.
